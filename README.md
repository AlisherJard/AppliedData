# MIT Applied Data Science Capstone Projects

## Project Overview

This repository contains the capstone projects for the MIT Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making. The program focused on the application of advanced data science techniques and AI tools to solve real-world problems and enhance decision-making processes.

### Projects:

1) **Marketing Campaign Analysis** The main objective is to develop a model that can effectively segment customers for a business. This requires thorough data exploration and transformation to ensure that the data is optimally structured for the segmentation model to interpret.
2) **PCA and t-SNE Project: Auto MPG** The objective of this problem is to **explore the data, reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, and extract meaningful insights.
3) **FoodHub Data Analysis** The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
4) **AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation** The objective of this problem is to **explore the data, reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, and extract meaningful insights.
