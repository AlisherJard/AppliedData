# MIT Applied Data Science Capstone Projects

## Program Overview

This repository contains the capstone projects for the MIT Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making. The program focused on the application of advanced data science techniques and AI tools to solve real-world problems and enhance decision-making processes.

### Projects:

1) **Marketing Campaign Analysis:** The primary goal is to create a model that can accurately segment a business's customers. This involves detailed data exploration and transformation to prepare the data in a way that is most suitable for the segmentation model to analyze and interpret effectively.
2) **PCA and t-SNE Project: Auto MPG:** The goal of this task is to analyze a dataset, apply dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and derive valuable insights for the automotive industry.
3) **FoodHub Data Analysis:** A food aggregator company has compiled data on various orders placed by customers through their online platform. The company aims to analyze this data to understand the demand for different restaurants better, which will aid in enhancing the customer experience. The main objective is to conduct a thorough data analysis to address specific questions that will assist the company in optimizing its business operations.
4) **AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation:** The aim of this project is to examine customer data from a bank, apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to simplify the dataset, and glean actionable insights from the reduced features.
